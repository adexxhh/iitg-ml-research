Predictive Maintenance Model for Army Vehicles for the Indian Army.
# Machine Learning Research Internship – IIT Guwahati

## Overview
This repository documents my work as a Machine Learning Research Intern at IIT Guwahati.
The project focused on building and evaluating multiple machine learning models to
identify the most effective approach for the given problem through systematic comparison.

## Problem Statement
The objective of this research was to analyze a real-world dataset and determine
the most suitable machine learning model by comparing performance across multiple
algorithms using standard evaluation metrics.

## Dataset
- Type: Tabular structured data
- Key challenges:
  - Feature variability
  - Possible class imbalance
  - Noise and missing values
- Note: Dataset details have been partially abstracted due to confidentiality.

## Methodology
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Data preprocessing and feature engineering
3. Training multiple ML models
4. Hyperparameter tuning
5. Comparative evaluation using standard metrics

## Models Evaluated
- Linear Regression / Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting / XGBoost

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC (where applicable)

## Results
Ensemble-based models demonstrated superior performance compared to linear and
distance-based methods, highlighting the importance of non-linear feature interactions.

## My Contributions
- Designed the end-to-end ML experimentation pipeline
- Implemented preprocessing and feature engineering
- Trained and evaluated multiple ML models
- Performed comparative analysis and result interpretation

## Tech Stack
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Note
This work was conducted under academic supervision at IIT Guwahati.
Certain implementation and dataset details have been omitted due to confidentiality.
